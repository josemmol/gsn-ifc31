# Introduction to Cloud Computing Using Amazon EC2

### Task 0: Download user-data.txt
- Download the following file from the GitHub repository to your computer:
  
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josemmol/gsn-ifc31/refs/heads/main/AWS/EC2-firststeps/user-data.txt

### Task 1: Open AWS Console
1. Access ***AWS Academy***, specifically the `Academy Learner Lab`.
2. Launch ***AWS Academy Learner Lab***
3. Click ***Start Lab*** and Open `AWS Console` to begin.

The objective is to launch two EC2 instances within the same region, but in different availability zones. Both instances will publish a web service that will be accessible via an Elastic IP (public IP).

### Task 2: VPC Preparation
1. Check that a default VPC has been created.
2. Go to ***Your VPCs*** and click on the VPC ID.
3. Click on ***Tags*** and add a tag where the key is `Name` and the value is `VPC-<region name>`.
4. Verify that there are two default subnets created in different availability zones.
5. Access the first subnet.
6. Click on ***Tags*** and add a tag where the key is `Name` and the value is `first-subnet`.
7. Access the second subnet.
8. Click on ***Tags*** and add a tag where the key is `Name` and the value is `second-subnet`.
9. Go to ***Security groups*** click on default security group.
10. Click on ***Inbound rules*** and edit inboundrules.
11. Add rule **HTTP (TCP port 80)** and source anywhere.
12. Add rule **SSH (TCP port 22)** and source anywhere.
13. And Save rules
   
### Task 3: Creating the First EC2 Instance
1. In the top navigation bar search box, type:
**ec2**
1. In the search results, under Services, click ***EC2***.
1. On the ***Dashboard***, click ***Launch instance***.
1. In the ***Name and tags*** section, for Name, type a name that you like, such as `webserver01`.
1. In the ***Application and OS Images*** section, under ***Quick Start***, choose **Amazon Linux**.
1. For ***Amazon Machine Image (AMI)***, on the dropdown list, keep or choose Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
1. For ***Instance type***, click Compare instance types.
1. In the Instance types section, review the available instances and their associated resources.
1. Choose the `t3.micro` instance type.
1. Review to confirm that the **t3.micro** instance type is selected.
1. For Key pair name, choose `vockey`. 
1. In the ***Network settings*** section, click Edit.
1. For ***VPC***, choose `VPC-<region name>`.
1. For ***Subnet***, choose the `first-subnet`.
1. For ***Security choose*** the **default** security group 
1. In the ***Configure storage*** section, keep the default selection of an 8 GiB gp3 volume. 
1. Click to expand ***Advanced details***.
1. For ***User data**, click Choose file.
1. In the pop-up box (not shown), choose the `user-data.txt` file that you downloaded to your device in an earlier step, and then review the file contents.
1. Review the Summary section.  
1. Click ***Launch instance***. In the success alert, review the message.
1. In the **Instances** section, choose the checkbox to select the available EC2 instance. Wait 2â€“3 minutes, and then click the section's refresh icon. Confirm that the instance is now running.
1. For the **running instance**, on the Details tab, under Public IPv4 DNS, click the copy icon to copy the provided address.
1. In a new browser tab (or window) address bar, type:
`http://`, paste the DNS address that you just copied and press Enter. On the page, review the details about your instance.

- If you see a connection timeout message when opening the webpage, check that the address begins with http:// and not https://.
- The public DNS and the security group are used to access the instance details that appear on the webpage. The public DNS record translates a domain name to an IP address. The record informs the browser which server to connect to.
- Take a screenshot of the browser

### Task 4: Connect to EC2 instances
1. Return to the ***Instances*** page on the Amazon EC2 console.
1. In the ***Instances*** section, click `Connect`.
1. Click the `EC2 Instance Connect` tab.
1. For ***Instance ID***, keep the default choice of ***Connect using a Public IP***.
1. Change the file `/var/www/html/index.html` so that your name appears on the page.
   
   Note: Make sure the httpd service is active by running command
   `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart|status httpd.service`
- Take a screenshot of the browser
- Take a screenshot of the console

### Task 5: Connect to EC2 instances with SSH client
1. Go to ***AWS Academy Learner Lab*** and click on `AWS Details`.
2. In the ***SSH key*** click on `Download PEM`.
3. Return to the ***Instances*** page on the Amazon EC2 console.
4. In the ***Instances*** section, click `Connect`.
5. Click the `SSH Client` tab.
6. Follow the instructions.
1. Run the following command `journalctl -u sshd.service -xe`
- Take a screenshot of the console
- Identify at least two connections: one from **Task 4** and another from **Task 5**.

### Task 6: Creating the Second EC2 Instance
- Create the second EC2 instance in the same way as the previous one, but select the `second-subnet`, which belongs to the other availability zone. 
- El nom ha de ser `webserver01`
- Take a screenshot of the browser

### Task 7: Connect to EC2 instances
- With `EC2 Instance Connect`, connect to the console and Change the file `/var/www/html/index.html` so that your name appears on the page.
- Take a screenshot of the browser
- Take a screenshot of the console

### Task 8: Connect to EC2 instances with SSH client
Run the following command `journalctl -u sshd.service -xe`
- Take a screenshot of the console
- Identify at least two connections: one from **Task 4** and another from **Task 5**.
